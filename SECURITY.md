# Security Policy

## Supported Versions
We support the latest released version. Older versions may not receive security fixes.

## Reporting a Vulnerability
Please do not open public issues for security vulnerabilities.

Instead, use GitHub Security Advisories:
- Go to the repository on GitHub
- Click Security -> Advisories -> New draft security advisory

If GitHub Security Advisories are not available, contact the maintainers via GitHub Discussions
and request a private reporting channel.

## Response Process
We aim to acknowledge reports within 72 hours and provide a fix or mitigation as soon as
reasonably possible.
